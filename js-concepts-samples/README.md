# JavaScript Concepts Samples

This project contains various JavaScript samples demonstrating common programming concepts. Each sample is organized in its own file within the `src` directory. Below is a brief overview of each sample:

## Samples Overview

- **variables.js**: Demonstrates variable declarations using `var`, `let`, and `const`, showcasing scope and hoisting.
  
- **functions.js**: Illustrates function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions, including examples of parameters and return values.
  
- **arrays.js**: Provides examples of array creation, manipulation methods (push, pop, shift, unshift), and iteration techniques (forEach, map).
  
- **objects.js**: Shows object creation, property access, and methods, along with examples of object destructuring and spread syntax.
  
- **promises.js**: Explains how to create and handle promises, including chaining and error handling with `.then()` and `.catch()`.
  
- **asyncAwait.js**: Demonstrates the async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations, including error handling with try/catch.
  
- **classes.js**: Illustrates class creation, inheritance, and the use of constructors and methods in JavaScript.
  
- **modules.js**: Shows how to export and import modules using ES6 syntax, including default and named exports.
  
- **errorHandling.js**: Provides examples of error handling using try/catch and throwing custom errors.

## Running the Samples

To run the samples, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

After that, you can execute each sample file using Node.js. For example:

```
node src/variables.js
```

Feel free to explore each file to understand the concepts better!
